        <h1>My Ice Challenges!</h1>
        <h2><a href="ice/apostle_spotlight/apostles.html" target="_blank">Apostle Spotlight!</a></h2>
        <p>In this challenge I made a box for the portraits of the Prophet, and all of the living, and at the time called, Apostles.
            I learned how to make how to make a picture a background using CSS, how to make a circle that will hold those portraits
            without any part of the portrait spilling out, how different statements in CSS inherit traits from each other, I learned 
            a lot about how to read the what's going on when you inspect a webpage in your browser.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="ice/boareding-pass/index.html" target="_blank">Boarding Pass</a></h2><!--Why did I spell boarding like that? Idk, I'm not changing it now.-->
        <p>In this challenge I made a copy of a boarding pass. I learned how to make a box, how to use a grid, how to add images, 
            and how to round the corners on the border of something.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="ice/font-awesome/index.html" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a></h2>
        <p>In this challenge I made a mock social media post. I learned how to add symbols from a website like Font Awesome&reg; to the webpage.</p>

        <h2><a href="ice/gallery/gallery.html" target="_blank">Gallery</a></h2>
        <p>In this challenge I learned about the need to make a large image smaller so that the webpage will load faster.
            I then made the original images smaller so that the webpage would load faster.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="ice/grid_flags/flags.html" target="_blank">Grid Flags</a></h2>
        <p>In this challenge I had to make the flags of different countries without changing the HTML that was provided to me. 
            In other words I had to do it only using CSS. I learned about Grid Gaps, and how to use Grid in more clever ways in general.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="ice/halloween/index.html" target="_blank">Halloween!</a></h2>
        <p>In this challenge I had to come up with a Halloween webpage. I didn't have any actually good ideas, so instead I did something 
            that made me laugh. Doing that actually ended up teaching me a lot about how block statements actually interact with the webpage
            because of the amount of hover psuedo classes I used in the CSS, in conjunction with div statements.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="ice/positioning/positioning.html" target="_blank">Positioning</a></h2>
        <p>This challenge was another excercise of only using CSS. We had to go through 6 different activities and replicate an image that
            provided to us for each. I learned how to better use grid and flexboxes, about using float:, and became more familliar with z-index:.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="ice/prophet_cards/nelson.html" target="_blank">Prophet Cards!</a></h2>
        <p>In this challenge I got to make a card in remembrance of of President Nelson. I learned how to center and arrange different items 
            so that they would be lined up with each other without being flush against the left side of the card.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="ice/signup/signup.html" target="_blank">Signup</a></h2>
        <p>In this challenge I had to make a mock place where people could sign up for a website. I learned a lot about positioning things 
            in individual grid boxes in a way that thing one would affect the position of thing 2. I also rememebered about using footers 
            for this challenge.
