    <h2>
        Client Report
    </h2>
    <p>I decide to have my site be about Moogles because some of my friends and I decided to start a ttrpg based on Final Fantasy where I am playing as a Moogle.
        I decided on the content by running prompts through AI for ideas, and from there I researched info that I could use to match the ideas that I liked.
        I then used AI to generate images based on the things that I researched (With the exception of the "My Kupo" image. I made that one.) so that everything I was using was free.
        We largely communicated through the Canvas Inbox, and while I can't say there was a much of an issue with how we communicated, I can definitely say there was an issue with the complete lack of communication.
        Some of the people working on my site very clearly were confused about what I was asking for with my siteplan, but instead of asking for clarification they just did their best. 
        It wasn't until later when I checked on the progress of my site that I caught that, and talked with them about it. My developers met my expectations for the most part. 
        I don't think my Lead Developer realized that I wanted an image underneath the paragraph on the Home page, but I forgot to ask them to add it in the end, so that was more my fault than theirs.
        The About Moogles page, which is subpage1, is largely not what I asked for, but I talked with them about it, and they said they would fix it. I don't know if they did and it just never got pushed to main, or if they just never got around to it though.
        The person who worked on my subpage2, the Moogle Culture and Society page, made everything exactly how I wanted it, so I'm very happy with that page.
        The next time I hire a team to do a project for me, I plan to make sure I have all of there numbers in a group chat so I can directly ask for updates on what's being done.

    <h2>
        Lead Developer Report
    </h2>
    <p>Personally I think I could have done a better job as the Lead Developer. While I did make sure we had all of the pictures and content that was asked for, I could have done better communicating who was doing what webpage.
        It all roughly got done without my needing to do that, but if I was more on top of things, I think the site as a whole would look better. 
        I largely communicated with my client through the Canvas Inbox, and I don't think there was any issues with that. When I needed things or had questions, they got back to me pretty quickly.

    <h2>
        Junior Developer Report 1
    </h2>
    <p>I largely didn't communicate with my team lead. At one point I wanted to know what baking goods images the client wanted, so I asked them directly and they said to use the images that were already provided.
        That's how I ended up using one picture each of bread, cookies, and cake for every different type of bakery item, but outside of that I wouldn't say there were any issues, and even that was barely an issue.
        I think I was able to contribute to the site. I took the wireframe for the page, and tried to match that as best I could while also coding it so it would look similar to the other pages.
        I didn't run into any issues with Github and adding changes to the site. I really didn't want to deal with merge conflicts, so when I was ready commit my changes, I used Ctrl+f to quickly make sure I didn't have any overlap with anyone else.

    <h2>
        Junior Developer Report 2
    </h2>
    <p>I talked a bit in person with my team lead for this page in person, but I actually didn't realize he was my team lead until really far into the project.
        This site genuinely had a lot of problems with it starting with the client accidentally leaving his laptop home after Thanksgiving, and ending with me not getting the siteplan and wireframe for what I was supposed to do until the Saturday before everything was due.
        That all led to the site looking nothing like was asked for in the site plan, but I did my best to follow the wireframe I was given, while making use of the CSS that was already made so that my page wouldn't stick out like a sore thumb.
        If I hadn't done that my page would be the only one that was green with Black Ops One font, and that would have been strange.
        I didn't have any issues with Github for this site either. I just used Ctrl+f again to make sure all the CSS I used wouldn't overlap with something someone else made.

    <h2>
        General Experience and Reflections
    </h2>
    <p>The most challenging part of this project for me was making sure I had everything done in time. 
        That was less because of the project itself, and more because of everything else I was juggling at the time. 
        It also didn't help that I thought the CSS was supposed to be done a week later than it was actually suppoed to be. 
        Which also means I thought both the Hiring and Setup, and the HTML was due a week later than actuality. 
        Thankfully for the Hiring and Setup, I still got everything to my dev team at the start of the week they were supposed to start the HTML proccess. 
        I did manage to get everything done by final due date though, so I think I overcame that. 
        If I was to redo this project I would do better to make sure that I finished everything by the time they were intended to be done.
        I would also try to do better at communicating with everyone. Not just the people I was a lead developer for, but as a junior developer to the lead dev, and a client to the entire dev team too.
        I absolutely feel more confident in working in a real-world project now. I can 100% see how you would be able to finish a website in a week if you have all the resources you need.
        This project also made me realize just how quickly I can make a webpage, compared to how long it would take me at the start of the semester to finish the first ICE challenge.
        I would say it took me close to 3 hours total to finish all the code for every webpage, HTML and CSS combined. There is a lot of code that get's shared across every page, for example the nav and footer sections.
        The HTML itself takes barely any time at all to write, and that's before you start borrowing code from someone else that fits your needs. 
        The CSS largely needs to be written only once, and anything unique to your page is probably still close enough to something someone else made that you can then copy and tweak to fit your needs.
